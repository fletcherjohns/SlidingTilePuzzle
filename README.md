This will be a simple sliding tile puzzle application with search algorithm to solve itself.
It will have controls for the number of tiles in either direction (3x3, 3x4, 4x4, etc)
It will have several tile designs to choose from, including replacing numbers with an image. By
splitting a bitmap into pieces.
It will allow shuffling to begin a game, then calculate optimal path and count user moves as they
play.
It will offer either next tile hint, or complete animated solve.
